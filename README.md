# buttonpusherTTRPG
An Obsidian Vault for managing TTRPG campaigns with these features:

- Importing data from a map created on [Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/) via JSON Import

## Getting Started

First, you'll want to download this vault and open it in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Download this vault. It contains all the plugins you need to get going. Primarily, the JSON import is handled by [JSON/CSV Importer](https://github.com/farling42/obsidian-import-json)

Once you've done that, open [[JSON Import How To]] for the instructions on how to get your FMG map imported into a campaign.
