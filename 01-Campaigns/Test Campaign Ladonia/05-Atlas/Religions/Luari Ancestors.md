%% During the import process, much of the data for the Leaflet fields should have been pulled in from the JSON. You will need to update the defaultZoom and (maybe) the coordinates values, but it should be pretty close - good enough to get a start with it. The goal is to cut down on the amount of manual effort you need to go through to pull your data in from the FMG JSON %%

### Zones/Regions/Neighborhoods
Below are any notable zones or regions within `=this.religionName`

%% Zones & regions are any areas that need to be defined. See Points of Interest below as another place to add specific locations that are noteworthy. You can identify Zones/Regions in the properties above (metadata is searchable/indexable). And you can add specific info about any of them below. Use '[!note]- {Zone/Region name}' to place each one in it's own callout. %%

### History

%% You can use the 'Timeline' Callout features of the ITS theme here to create a timeline of any important events. Remove the line below that reads '(delete this line to enable timeline)' and the trailing double percent signs & add a set of double percent signs here ->

> [!timeline|t-l] **`=this.religionName` Founded** _Date of founding._
> `=this.religionName` was founded by...

> [!timeline|t-l t-2] **Something Happened** *A significant event.*
> Something momentous occurred on this day.

> [!timeline|t-r t-2] **Another thing happened** *Less significant this time.*
> Today was only a moderately important day.

(delete this line to enable timeline) %%

## Notes

%% Further notes. These 2 callouts will be hidden by default. Change the '-' after the closing square bracket to a '+' to have it be expanded by default. %%
