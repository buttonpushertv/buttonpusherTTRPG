### Zones/Regions/Neighborhoods
Below are any notable zones or regions within `=this.cultureName`

%% Zones & regions are any areas that need to be defined. See Points of Interest below as another place to add specific locations that are noteworthy. You can identify Zones/Regions in the properties above (metadata is searchable/indexable). And you can add specific info about any of them below. Use '[!note]- {Zone/Region name}' to place each one in it's own callout. %%

### History

%% You can use the 'Timeline' Callout features of the ITS theme here to create a timeline of any important events. Remove the line below that reads '(delete this line to enable timeline)' and the trailing double percent signs & add a set of double percent signs here ->

> [!timeline|t-l] **`=this.cultureName` Founded** _Date of founding._
> `=this.cultureName` was founded by...

> [!timeline|t-l t-2] **Something Happened** *A significant event.*
> Something momentous occurred on this day.

> [!timeline|t-r t-2] **Another thing happened** *Less significant this time.*
> Today was only a moderately important day.

(delete this line to enable timeline) %%

## Notes

%% Further notes. These 2 callouts will be hidden by default. Change the '-' after the closing square bracket to a '+' to have it be expanded by default. %%

## More Details

%% The metadata sections below allow you to add some detailed info about NPCs, Groups, Points of Interest, and Shops & Services.

Change the '-' after the closing square bracket of each callout line (starts with open bracket followed by an exclamation point) to a '+' to have it be expanded by default.
