%% If you want to place the image for the Burg in the Map(Interactive) window below, you can use Fantasy Map Generator's link to Watabou's Fantasy City or Village Generator - see the `infobox` link or the `burgMapLink` URL up in the properties of this note. You can save the map image somewhere in the vault (`91-Assets/your_campaign_subfolder`, for instance) and it will show up in this window. There is an elaborate method (see [[JSON Import How To#Wrangling FMG Burg Maps]]) to save all the maps so you can have them locally and make use of the data that was placed here on import from the JSON.%%

> > The `scale` setting of `.5` is arbitrary. It seems to work for Village maps. There is no scale, but by setting the unit (in the Leaflet block above) to `feet` things seem to feel about the right size.
> > 
> > If it's a City Generator map, there is a scale legend, but they don't seem to have a uniform sizing. The scale can be different, even between multiple maps with a `0-200m` scale legend. It's annoying, and can probably be ignored, but if you *want* to get it close, you can adjust it.
> > 
> >  In Leaflet, zoom in to the corner where the scale legend is and, by Shift-Clicking, you can create a measurement tool. Start at '0' and measure over to the first increment. Adjust the `scale` value in the Leaflet block above so that the measurement tool is accurate. It's difficult to get it exactly precise. Once you start adjusting them, though you begin to develop a sense of which way to go to get it dialed.
> >
> > Oh, and *yes*, it is annoying that Villages work in `feet` and Cities are in `meters`. These are *your* maps though. There's nothing to say you can't set City maps to all be in `yards` instead of `meters`. The distances will be near enough.
