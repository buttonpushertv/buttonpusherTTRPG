%% If you want to place the image for the Burg in the Map(Interactive) window below, you can use Fantasy Map Generator's link to Watabou's Fantasy City or Village Generator - see the `infobox` link or the `burgMapLink` URL up in the properties of this note. You can save the map image somewhere in the vault (`91-Assets/your_campaign_subfolder`, for instance) and it will show up in this window. The name for this image is pre-populated with info from the JSON Import. The filename should be the Burg's id value and the Burg's burgName - both available up in the frontmatter.

You may also use the Meta-Bind button at the bottom of the callout to open the burgMapLink in a browser window and save it there. On clicking that button, you will open the Burg's URL (City or Village) and then it will set this Burg's index and name on the clipboard like this: {id}-{burgName} - you can then just paste that in to the file name field of the save file dialog window, once you navigate to the vault folder you want to save them into.

There is an elaborate method (see [[JSON Import How To#Wrangling FMG Burg Maps]]) to save all the maps so you can have them locally and make use of the data that was placed here on import from the JSON.%%

%% City Maps may need Scale adjusting - see `unit: feet` line above in Leaflet block (around line 80-81) The `scale` setting of `1` is arbitrary. It seems to work for the Burg maps - City or Village. By default the CityGen maps will likely have the `scale bar` visible. I recommend hiding it. The City Gen uses meters. The Village Gen has no scale defined. Once you hide it in the CityGen Settings, it should stay hidden for several visits to these maps.%%

### Zones/Regions/Neighborhoods
Below are any notable zones or regions within `=this.burgName`

%% Zones & regions are any areas that need to be defined. See Points of Interest below as another place to add specific locations that are noteworthy. You can identify Zones/Regions in the properties above (metadata is searchable/indexable). And you can add specific info about any of them below. Use '[!note]- {Zone/Region name}' to place each one in it's own callout. %%

### History

%% You can use the 'Timeline' Callout features of the ITS theme here to create a timeline of any important events. Remove the line below that reads '(delete this line to enable timeline)' and the trailing double percent signs & add a set of double percent signs here ->

> `=this.burgName` was founded by...

> [!timeline|t-l t-2] **Something Happened** *A significant event.*
> Something momentous occurred on this day.

> [!timeline|t-r t-2] **Another thing happened** *Less significant this time.*
> Today was only a moderately important day.

(delete this line to enable timeline) %%

## Notes
