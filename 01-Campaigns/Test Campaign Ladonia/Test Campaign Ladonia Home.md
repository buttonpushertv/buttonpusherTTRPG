# The World of Test Campaign Ladonia

> [!EXAMPLE] SAMPLE FMG MAP Import
> This is an example of what this process creates.
> 
> It is imported from the JSON file at:
> 99-Templates/Handlebar-JSON/Ladonia Full 2024-03-31-10-23-MODDED.json
> 
> You can see what the import process creates before trying it out on your own worlds (since it's a bit of work to get things set up to import).
> 
> I have left the Dropbox link to the FMG map up as well(as long as it lasts) so you can see how that interaction works - see a State or Atlas Leaflet block has a link to it's location in the FMG map file - it's pretty cool
> 
> Also, with this example, I haven't done much to update things, so you can see some of the issues that arise during import. Look at the State of [[Alocenia]] - it has no provinces and the Capital gets some confused links in the [[Test Campaign Ladonia-Linked Atlas]]. Worth seeing the kinds of problems that arise.
> 
> One last minute change is that I had to convert the Burg Map images to WEBP - Github kept timing out on upload of the PNG versions. That conversion is not yet documented, but it's in this test import to conserve space.

## Sessions

%% This Session Hub file is part of a future idea. I hope to have the ability to create a session note for the 'next session'. And also have a button that will then pull up all the dates of the subsequent sessions along with their comments. Only partly implemented thus far. %%
